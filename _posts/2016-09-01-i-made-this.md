# I made this.

In 1996, procrastination brought me to the world wide web, one hand-coded line on HTML in emacs on a UNIX terminal login at a time. I had no idea the potent mix of a little code and a little Photoshop was going to change my life and become the start of a career of internet magic.

In 2016, I have a website built on my own content and designed by an AI. After 15 years as an interactive and UX/UI designer, not pushing the pixels by my own hand is tough to fathom.

So this is a separate page? Weird!
