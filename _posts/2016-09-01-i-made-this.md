# I made this.

In 1996, procrastination brought me to the world wide web, one hand-coded line in HTML in emacs on a UNIX terminal login at a time. I had no idea the potent mix of a little code and a little Photoshop was going to change my life and become the start of a career of internet magic.

In 2016, I have a website built on my own content and designed by an AI. After 15 years as an interactive and UX/UI designer, not pushing the pixels by my own hand is tough to fathom.

**Most recently at AHA**

One skill I bring everywhere is digital savvy, and AHA needed to up its game as clients asked for more digital solutions to their marketing and communications goals. I came onboard as their first Interactive Creative Director, leading the Silicon Valley Bank creative team.

I quickly transitioned into a broader, innovation-focused role across the agency as Innovation Director, with the goal of bringing my experience to more teams, finding new opportunities within current clients, and bringing more skills and partnerships to the agency.

Because website overhauls are a thing for agencies, I lead the AHA website brand relaunch project in the fall of 2015\. I treated it like a client project, from working with strategists on research and insights, to crafting a content strategy that still guides the site, to developing an experience that is evidence of the AHA brand from visuals to interactions to every word on the screen. It seems like a small thing, but the new AHA website has changed the conversation with clients and prospects, and is leading to a whole new way people see AHA and want to work with them.

In the last year I've worked with clients at Nike, Charles Schwab, HP and HPE, and SVB. 

**The Webtrends years**

From 2011-2014 I was the creative director at [Webtrends][0], leading the corporate marketing team in developing brand campaigns to build awareness and generate demand for Webtrends products and services. This included two website overhauls, two rebrands, two customer conferences, and countless campaigns. And a flying shark.

While the design of webtrends.com has changed since 2014, you can still find some of my team's work around the tubes. In the interest of drinking our own champagne, we chronicled our marketing optimization programs and testing at **[backstage.webtrends.com][1]**. We tested button labels and placement. We tested images of kittens versus images of llamas. We tested everyone's favorite scourge of the web: the home page hero carousel. We tested social campaigns and live events. And we shared our results, the good and the bad.

To get the attention of CMOs, VPs and directors in marketing organizations we launched a campaign showing the outcomes and value to customers when companies harness the power of data in their marketing. We launched **[datadidthat.com][2]** as a way to show what data can do for you. 

Apologies if either site acts janky, they're just lurking unmaintained and wild.

**Freelancing, starting a small agency, and teaching**

You haven't lived as a designer until you've had your own studio, and I did.

In 2010 I designed the touch-screen user interface for the **[Fluke Networks DTX CableAnalyzer Series][3]**device, working with a top-notch UX and research team. I designed the UI for **[Stockamp/Huron Consulting's][4]** enterprise medical application working with the same team.

In 2009 I was the design lead on a complete overhaul of the **[Tripwire][5]** website, long since redone. I consulted with **[XPLANE][6]** to develop interactive pieces for Sungard, Alcatel-Lucent, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence.

I've worked with brands such as Intel, HP, and Microsoft.

**Things I make because I like making things.**

**[5 Minute Logos][7]** - for $1, I will spend 5 minutes making you the logo you request.

**[Hey Corporate Girl][8]** - Ryan Gosling on corporate life

**[I Can See Into Your Hotel Room][9]** -- A view into the Portland Hilton.

**[Highfive Cycling][10]** -- my women's cycling team, where I do everything from kit design to organizing rides to racing bikes.
