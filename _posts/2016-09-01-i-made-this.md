# I made this.

In 1996, procrastination brought me to the world wide web, one hand-coded line in HTML in emacs on a UNIX terminal login at a time. I had no idea the potent mix of a little code and a little Photoshop was going to change my life and become the start of a career of internet magic.

In 2016, I have a website built on my own content and designed by an AI. After 15 years as an interactive and UX/UI designer, not pushing the pixels by my own hand is tough to fathom.

**Freelancing, starting a small agency, and teaching**

You haven't lived as a designer until you've had your own studio, and I did.

In 2010 I designed the touch-screen user interface for the **[Fluke Networks DTX CableAnalyzer Series][0]**device, working with a top-notch UX and research team. I designed the UI for **[Stockamp/Huron Consulting's][1]** enterprise medical application working with the same team.

In 2009 I was the design lead on a complete overhaul of the **[Tripwire][2]** website, long since redone. I consulted with **[XPLANE][3]** to develop interactive pieces for Sungard, Alcatel-Lucent, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence.

I've worked with brands such as Intel, HP, and Microsoft.

**Things I make because I like making things.**

**[5 Minute Logos][4]** - for $1, I will spend 5 minutes making you the logo you request.

**[Hey Corporate Girl][5]** - Ryan Gosling on corporate life

**[I Can See Into Your Hotel Room][6]** -- A view into the Portland Hilton.

**[Highfive Cycling][7]** -- my women's cycling team, where I do everything from kit design to organizing rides to racing bikes.
