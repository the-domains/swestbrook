# I made this.

In 1996, procrastination brought me to the world wide web, one hand-coded line in HTML in emacs on a UNIX terminal login at a time. I had no idea the potent mix of a little code and a little Photoshop was going to change my life and become the start of a career of internet magic.

In 2016, I have a website built on my own content and designed by an AI. After 15 years as an interactive and UX/UI designer, not pushing the pixels by my own hand is tough to fathom.

**Things I make because I like making things.**

**[5 Minute Logos][0]** - for $1, I will spend 5 minutes making you the logo you request.

**[Hey Corporate Girl][1]** - Ryan Gosling on corporate life

**[I Can See Into Your Hotel Room][2]** -- A view into the Portland Hilton.

**[Highfive Cycling][3]** -- my women's cycling team, where I do everything from kit design to organizing rides to racing bikes.
